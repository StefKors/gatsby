I have to admit that I have a fondness for people's personal websites. from the webdesign that has stayed there since they first buildt it, to the random articles about work, mixed in with passion projects and personal notes. I always liked having a personal website, and for awhile social media was everyones personal site. The personal has dissapeared more and more. However instead of looking back with sadness at our rotten links. I think instead we should embrace change. 

I'm proposing we look at websites more as seasonal wardrobes, changing with whim and fashion, thowing out what's old and keeping what's dear to us. Thus I welcome you to my window 2020 website.
