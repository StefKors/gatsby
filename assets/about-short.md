Stef Kors is a developer with a background in design and user research. His favourite work takes place at the intersection of design and code, building great websites with great people.

Right now he works at [Beam](https://beamapp.co/) building a new type of browser that's pushing the idea of how we work on and with the web. Before that he ran [oneacre.online](https://www.oneacre.online) together with [Victoria](http://dkdkpl.com) and [Titus](http://titusknegtel.nl), oneacre.online is a publication project for experimental long-form writing.

He completed a bachelor in Communication and Multimedia Design at The Hague University of Applied Sciences with minors in Service Design and Co-Design. At the end of the day, he likes to build things — online and offline — that work well and efficiently.
